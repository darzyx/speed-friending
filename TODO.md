- Add admin auth login feature (or change password)
- Check all components for infinite rerender issues

MID PRIORITY

LOW PRIORITY

- Consider adding light mode (should be easy)

- Remove hard coded max groups number
- Only render participant modals when necessary
- CenterMiddle css should have margin+padding set to zero (so some custom
  containers are no longer necessary)
