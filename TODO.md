HIGH PRIORITY

- Check that firebase will allow many connections from same IP address

LOW PRIORITY

- Audio on mobile stops working when leave app
- Make string values numbers where appropriate on create form
- Limit amount of groups on backend to maxGroups const (only I can add/delete,
  so this is low priority)
  - Add admin auth login feature (or change password)
- Check all components for infinite rerender issues
- Design updates: make it look nice
