HIGH PRIORITY

- Make sure Firebase can handle 400 users at once day of
- Site crashes if min values are entered. But don't want to validate pre submit
  because of UX on entering field values. Should validate post submit attempt

MID PRIORITY

- Add admin auth login feature (or change password)
- Update info modal copy

LOW PRIORITY

- Consider adding light mode (should be easy)
- Make string values numbers where appropriate on create form
- Remove hard coded max groups number
