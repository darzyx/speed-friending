HIGH PRIORITY

- Make sure Firebase can handle 400 users at once day of
- Check all components for infinite rerender issues

MID PRIORITY

- Update info modal copy
- Record and display on what round a dropout drops out
- Design updates: make it look nice

LOW PRIORITY

- Add admin auth login feature (or change password)
- Consider adding light mode (should be easy)
- Make string values numbers where appropriate on create form
- Remove hard coded max groups number
- Consider renaming `round_active` to `num_round_active` or something
- Only render participant modals when necessary
- CenterMiddle css should have margin+padding set to zero (so some custom
  containers are no longer necessary)
